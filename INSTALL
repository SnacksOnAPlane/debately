---- GETTING STARTED ----

To create a new debately django project, simply follow these instructions. 
(Note that this is for starting a local testing/development project, 
and NOT a suggested deployment strategy).

1. Start a new django project ( This is a quick overview, much more detailed 
information can be found in the Django tutorial
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/ )

Run the following command to create a new Django project and 
download the debately source. This will create a new directory 
named YOUR_PROJECT. (replace 'YOUR_PROJECT' with whatever you'd like
to name your new project)

  django-admin.py startproject YOUR_PROJECT
  cd YOUR_PROJECT
  git clone git://github.com/SnacksOnAPlane/debately.git 

You should now have a directory named YOUR_PROJECT, and a subdirectory
named debately which contains the debately app files.

2. Edit YOUR_PROJECT/setting.py:
Some example values for the settings.py. 

    # your database connection setting.
    DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
    DATABASE_NAME = '/tmp/debately.db' 

    # include the debately app in your INSTALLED_APPS
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.admin',
    	'django.contrib.auth',
    	'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    	'django.contrib.sessions',
    	'django.contrib.sites',
    	'debately'
    )

3. Edit YOUR_PROJECT/urls.py:
    # uncomment these line to enable the admin
    from django.contrib import admin
    admin.autodiscover()

    # this sends all requests except admin pages to 
    # the debately app, If you'd like to run additional
    # apps, this will need to be modified.
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        (r'', include('debately.urls')),
    )


4. Create database and load fixture data:

Run the following command from your project directory to create the
initial database:

    python manage.py syncdb

When promted to create an admin user, you can select 'no' as we
will load userdata from the included fixtures

Use the following command to load test fixtures:    
    
    python manage.py loaddata debately/fixtures/debately_data.json

The fixtures will install 3 sample users (alice, bob, and charlie, 
passwords same as usernames) and a sample "tastes great/less filling" debate.
It will also install an admin user (username admin, password admin).
    
You should now be able to start your development server:

    python manage.py runserver

and then point your browser to 
    http://localhost:8000

If everything went well you should now see the debately "recent debates" 
page.
